THE ASM FILES WERE IMPLEMENTED FULLY
HOWEVER FOR THE ASSIGNMENT3 ASM WHICH
PRINTS THE DIR INFO, THE STRING THAT I CREATED
IS TOO MUCH TO FIT CORRECTLY INTO MEMORY 
SO IT SOMETIMES SHOWS AN ERROR THAT SAYS
"UNIMPLEMENTED INSTRUCTION". I BELIEVE THIS IS 
BECAUSE I WRITE OVER TO AN ALREADY OCCUPIED 
MEMORY SOMETIMES.

SAME THING APPLIES WHEN FILES SIZES GET TOO BIG.
SO IF YOU SEE AN ERROR SIMILAR TO THIS KNOW THAT 
IT IS BECAUSE OF THE MEMORY.

FOR THE DEBUGGING I ACCEPTED DIR INFO AND TABLE
AS THE SAME SINCE YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING FROM THERE.

I COULDN'T FIND A PROPER METHOD TO SHOW TIME AND DATE 
THAT IS SUPPORTED BY C++98 SINCE MOST OF THEM ARE
SUPPORTED ONLY BY C++11 AND ABOVE. THE METHOD I FOUND
PRINTS DATE AND TIME BUT FOR THE TIME PART IT DOESN'T 
WORK FULLY CORRECTLY. FOR EXAMPLE IF THE TIME IS
15:06 IT SHOWS 05:06, FOR 19:54 IT SHOWS 09;54 ETC.
HOWEVER THIS DOESNT REALLY CHANGE MUCH SINCE THE GOAL IS
TO CHECK THE DIFFERENCES.

I ADDED 5 FILESYSTEM.DAT FILES. EACH OF WHICH INCLUDES
ATLEAST 2 FILES. YOU CAN SEE THE BYTES. SINCE I CREATED 
THEM USING ASM1 THEY HAVE ATLEAST 50 BYTES.

FOR THE NAMING PART I NAMED THE ASSEMBLY FILES AS ASSIGNMENT1,
ASSIGNMENT2, ... ASSIGNMENT4 ETC SINCE YOU REQUESTED FROM THE MOODLE
PAGE. THEY ARE IN THE SAME ORDER AS DESCRIBED IN THE HW PDF.
